# Impact

## Problem addressed

Teams often need a lightweight but realistic AI integration baseline before committing to larger platform investments.

## Outcome

This repo now demonstrates a complete, recruiter-reviewable path:

- secure server-side inference with no client token exposure
- normalized API contracts for success and error handling
- deployable full-stack Next.js example on Vercel
- screenshot-backed docs for fast technical evaluation

## Practical use cases

- interview walkthrough for API design and deployment strategy
- starter template for small AI product experiments
- internal proof-of-concept before adopting multi-model architecture

## Next roadmap

- add streaming token responses for long outputs
- add request logging and latency dashboards
- add preset prompt templates by use case
